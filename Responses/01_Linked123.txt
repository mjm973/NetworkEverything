I liked the way Linked has dealt with the topic of networks so far. I think it is important to understand them both in a concrete way - say, as exemplified by societies or the internet - as well as an abstract way - one which highlights the fundamental structure underlying all these systems. Furthermore, I enjoyed the dip into the mathematics of graphs and networks, as well as the hostorical trivia on the development of networks and their understanding. I had heard of Six Degrees of Separation, but not of all the history and research behind the concept. A modern-day euivalent of the original experiment was performed by the science YouTube channel, Veritasium, and he obtained very similar results!
