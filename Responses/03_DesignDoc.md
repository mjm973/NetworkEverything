### Tired of laundry machines with timers that never finish on time?

### Done with people taking out your laundry before it's done???

## Then Laundry Fren (TM) is for you! 

Stick it to the laundry machine using its magnetic base, press the button, and you are set! 
An accelerometer inside your Fren detects when the laundry machine is operational, allowing Laundry Fren to notify you via e-mail
when the machine stops. Now you'll know exactly when your laundry is done - or if someone took it out!

#### The program

Laundry Fren has three main inputs. The first is a <b>POWER SWITCH</b> that allows you to - you guessed it! - turn your Fren off when
not in use. The second is a <b>HI-TECH PUSH BUTTON</b> that engages your Fren to start monitoring your laundry and disengages him when
you are done. The third is where the magic happens: the <b>ACCELEROMETER</b> detects vibrations from the laundry machine.

The push button toggles Laundry Fren between engaged (active) or disengaged (inactive). When engaged,
your Laundry Fren takes in the vibration information via its analog input pins. If the vibration level is somewhat constant, your 
Fren will stay idle. <b>BUT</b> if your Laundry Fren detects a sharp change in vibration, he will notify you via e-mail, whether 
the machine has been stopped or started again!
