### Useful: [Wink](https://www.wink.com/)

Apparently, Wink is a hub for all your smart home devices. I'm not sure if IoT gadgets will and up 
being so prevalent in our lives, but if they are I'd rather have an extra thing to keep track of all 
my other things than trying to make different brands/protocols of IoT gadgets play nice with one another by 
myself.

Essentially, it seems you breathe into this and it gives you data on your oral health. 
Kinda neat until you realize any human being could tell you that yes, your breath stinks, and yes,
maybe you should brush your teeth. Friends are free (!), and it's not like this thing is going to 
replace your dentist anytime soon.
